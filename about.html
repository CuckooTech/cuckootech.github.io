            <h2>About Cuckoo</h2>
            <p class="lead">

            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Any resources stored in Cuckoo, including text, images, sounds, videos and website code, will generate an unique address after hashing and you can play and share videos just by this code in Cuckoo which is totally anonymous. As the P2P connection, the more you subscribe and use Cuckoo, the faster it will be. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Because of the protection of the encryption algorithm and P2P connection, every channel's address in Cuckoo has the characteristics of being tamper-resistant and cannot be deleted (in a sense, if the password is cracked, it may be tampered with or deleted, but the probability is extremely low). So, once the video or data is stored in Cuckoo, it will be permanent. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The users, companies and founders in Cuckoo will look different than they have in the past because Cuckoo is more decentralized, more freedom and more globally connected. By video funding and sharing,building the future of rights managerment and P2P distribution,every video and channel will be easily controlled, shared and managed by the Cuckoo users from development to distribution. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
